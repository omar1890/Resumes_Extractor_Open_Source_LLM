Error: Invalid JSON

To extract the structured fields from the CV text, we need to follow these steps:

1. Create a JSON object to store the extracted information.
2. Parse through the CV text line by line to identify potential structured fields.
3. Extract the relevant information such as full name, email, phone number, education, work experience, and skills using regular expressions or string manipulation techniques.
4. Store each piece of information in its respective field within the JSON object.
5. Repeat this process for all the lines until all fields are extracted.
6. Return the completed JSON object as the output.

Here is an example of how the structured fields can be extracted from the CV text:
